I'm a MSc Computer Science student at the Delft University of Technology. During my master track I've had the pleasure to have followed two courses given by Erik Meijer (former Microsoft employee). Erik was involved in the creation of the Rx framework in Microsoft's .NET C#. If you're not familiar with Rx, I would recommend some of the videos found on [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/Rx/).

One of the courses Erik has been teaching is Reactive Programming where he covers the Rx framework and the thoughts behind it. As a part of the course, we were asked to contribute to the Rx ecosystem in whatever programming language we liked. I choose to contribute to Netflix's RxJava. Last week I presented my contributions and experiences to my fellow students. Below you can find the presentation slides I used.
